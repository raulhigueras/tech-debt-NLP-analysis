# tech-debt-NLP-analysis

Natural Language Processing analysis of developers' written messages in the Technical Debt Database to predict issues' difficulty.


## Project Status
------------

- [x] Problem Understanding
- [x] Data Exploration 
- [ ] Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Modeling
- [ ] Evaluation
- [ ] Deploy


## Instructions
------------

### Setup
First of all, run the following command to install all the python libraries needed.
```{bash}
make requirements
```

### Data Exploration
The data exploration part is all contained in the notebook `001-exploration.ipnb`. To see the whole analysis, just run the notebook from the start of the document.

> ❗️ Warning
>
> Make sure to include both versions of the databases (`td_V1.bd` and `td_V2.bd`) in the folder `data/raw`.

### 🚧 Data Preprocessing 🚧
To generate the processed dataset, run the following command:
```{bash}
make data
```

### 🚧 Modeling 🚧
